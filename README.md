# 🧰 Technology Stack & Purpose

This section outlines the key technologies used in the Airbnb Clone Backend project and their specific roles in the development and deployment process.

## 🖥️ Backend Framework

**Django**  

A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs for handling users, bookings, properties, and more.

**Django REST Framework (DRF)**  

An extension of Django used to build powerful and flexible RESTful APIs. Provides out-of-the-box tools for serialization, authentication, and routing.

## 💾 Database & Query Language

**PostgreSQL**  

An advanced open-source relational database used for managing and storing application data efficiently, with support for complex queries and indexing.

**GraphQL**

A flexible query language that allows clients to request only the data they need. Complements REST by enabling efficient and tailored data fetching from the backend.

## ⚙️ Asynchronous Task Management

**Celery**

A distributed task queue used to run background jobs asynchronously, such as sending notifications, processing payments, or handling batch updates.

## 🚀 Caching & Performance

**Redis**

An in-memory data store used for caching and session management, significantly improving application speed and reducing database load.

## 📦 Containerization

**Docker**  

Used to package the application into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## 🔁 Continuous Integration & Deployment

**GitHub Actions**

A CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub that automates workflows like testing, building, and deploying the backend services on every code push or pull request.

## 🧪 API Documentation

**OpenAPI (Swagger)**

A standard format for describing RESTful APIs, used to auto-generate clear and interactive API documentation for easier integration and testing.

## 📄 Markdown

**Markdown**  
A lightweight markup language used for formatting text in project documentation such as `README.md`, issues, and GitHub wikis.

## 🌐 Version Control & Collaboration

**Git & GitHub**  
Git is a version control system, and GitHub is the platform used for hosting code, managing collaboration, reviewing changes, and deploying via CI/CD pipelines.
