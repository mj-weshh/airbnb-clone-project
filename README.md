# 👥 Project Roles & Responsibilities

This section outlines the key team roles and their responsibilities in the Airbnb Clone Backend Project. These roles are based on both the project scope and best practices from industry leaders such as ITRexGroup.


## 🧠 Backend Developer

- Implements RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints (e.g., users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews).
- Writes core business logic and integrates backend frameworks (e.g., Django, DRF).
- Collaborates on database schema design and ensures system performance and security.
- Works closely with DevOps and QA to ensure smooth CI/CD integration and test coverage.

## 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)

- Designs and manages the relational database schema (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Defines entity relationships, indexes, constraints, and normalization rules.
- Implements performance tuning strategies (e.g., indexing, caching with Redis).
- Ensures database reliability, backups, and integrity through monitoring tools.

## ⚙️ DevOps Engineer

- Sets up Docker environments and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
- Manages deployment configurations, load balancing, and system monitoring.
- Automates testing, build, and release cycles for consistent development-to-production flows.
- Ensures system scalability and reliability in real-world hosting environments.

## ✅ Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

- Develops and executes test plans and test cases for all backend functionality.
- Identifies, logs, and tracks bugs to resolution in collaboration with developers.
- Verifies that APIs meet the OpenAPI specifications and ensure user-facing accuracy.
- Conducts regression, integration, and performance testing during the project lifecycle.

## 🏗️ Software Architect

- Defines the high-level architecture of the system (e.g., service layers, API design).
- Selects appropriate technologies, frameworks, and third-party services.
- Maintains balance between performance, maintainability, and scalability.
- Guides engineering decisions, code structure, and architectural consistency.

## 📅 Project Manager / Dev Lead

- Oversees sprint planning, task distribution, and timeline tracking.
- Coordinates between stakeholders, developers, QA, and DevOps.
- Ensures the project progresses toward its goals with minimal blockers.
- Maintains team motivation and resolves conflicts as they arise.

## 📊 Business Analyst / Product Owner *(Optional)*

- Gathers user requirements and translates them into technical documentation.
- Prioritizes features and maintains the product backlog.
- Acts as a bridge between business goals and development execution.
- Ensures that development stays aligned with user needs and stakeholder vision.
